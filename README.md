Vegam Paints – Static Website (HTML & CSS)

Vegam Paints is a fully responsive static website created using only HTML5 and CSS3, designed to represent a premium paint manufacturing brand. The project focuses on clean layout structure, modern visual design, and brand-oriented presentation without relying on JavaScript frameworks or external libraries. It serves as a front-end demonstration of how semantic HTML and well-structured CSS can be used to build a professional corporate website.

The website includes a visually engaging hero section, detailed company overview, product categories, service highlights, customer testimonials, FAQs, and a contact section with an inquiry form. Special attention is given to typography, spacing, color consistency, and section hierarchy to ensure a smooth and intuitive user experience. The layout is fully responsive, adapting seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile screen sizes using CSS flexbox and grid techniques.

This project is ideal for showcasing front-end fundamentals such as semantic markup, responsive design, reusable CSS components, and modern UI styling practices. It is suitable for beginners and intermediate developers looking to understand real-world website structure using core web technologies only.
